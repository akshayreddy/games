# Introduction
 
This is an attempt to explore the field of artificial intelligence in a fun and engaging way. What better way to do it than developing games!
 
Over the time the repository will contain a bunch of 2D (mostly) games with a goal to design them with some abstractness and  imbibe a bit of intelligence into the actors.

Destroy most of the enemies while saving your spaceship from the missiles that at times follow you.
 
# :thumbsup: Contribution
 
Most of the games will be playable; in the sense, there will be a room for a lot of enhancements. Feel free to suggest new features, gameplays suggestions and bugs. Just open a pull request!
